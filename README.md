cd DigiKey-Component-Lookup-Tool
```

### 2. Set up Python virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

- **Windows PowerShell:**
```bash

## DigiKey API Setup

1. You need to create a free account at [DigiKey Developer Portal](https://developer.digikey.com/)
2. Watch this helpful video by eeintech: https://youtu.be/OI1EGEc0Ju0?si=-jcA02vf3ZqAk8kV
3. Register an app to get:
   - `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID`
   - `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_SECRET`
4.Make sure to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the file:

```
DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
DIGIKEY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

---

## Run the Tool

After activating your virtual environment and editing your `.env` file:

```bash
python digikey_lookup.py
```

On first run, a browser will open for DigiKey login and authorization.  
> If the browser shows a warning (e.g., "not private"), you can **safely proceed** — it's part of DigiKey's localhost-based OAuth login.

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
Enter part name or number (or 'q' to quit): atmega328pu
```

- View a list of matching results
- Choose the part number to see full details
- Choose to export (single or all results)
- Save as `.csv` or `.xlsx`
- View analytics:
  - Average quantity available
  - Parts per manufacturer

---

## Tips for Users

- Python 3.11+ is recommended (script was developed on 3.11.9).
- If you get a `distutils` error, run:

```bash
pip install setuptools
```

- If you get a `ModuleNotFoundError`, try:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv digikey-api pandas openpyxl tabulate
```
